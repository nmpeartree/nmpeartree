# Welcome to the PearTree projects!

Howdy! I'm a senior engineer (now a program manager) who has worked in the tech industry for over 20 years. I've kept a couple of gaming project repos up that I 
have built many years ago that were originally inspired by [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger) and the 1975 movie [Death Race](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072856/) starring Sylvester Stallone.

Other than what is publically available, I maintain a couple of private projects for a site I built named [mynycday](https://mynycday.com) using Reach 16 and Material-UI. If you want details, kindly send me a message!
